    # R04 from the review of eprbell/rp2#155: the Open Positions report must show each wallet's actual remaining cost basis.
    #
    # The rule in plain English: from 2025, US taxpayers track cost basis wallet by wallet. Each wallet has its own coins with their own cost
    # and purchase dates (IRC §1012(c)(1): "on an account by account basis"; Treas. Reg. §1.1012-1(j)(1) and (j)(3): units are identified
    # within each wallet or broker account). Coins that were bought before 2025 and not yet sold get their cost assigned to the wallets at
    # the start of 2025 (Rev. Proc. 2024-28 §5.02, global allocation). So a wallet's cost basis is the cost of the coins that wallet holds.
    #
    # Example (from the review): in 2025 buy 1 coin for $100 in Coinbase and 1 coin for $1,000 in Kraken. Coinbase's cost basis is $100 and
    # Kraken's is $1,000. Before the fix the report spread the $1,100 total over the coins and showed $550 for each wallet.
    #
    # Each case checks the actual report cells: the balance and cost basis of every holder ("Asset" sheet) and every wallet ("Asset -
    # Exchange" sheet), that the per-unit cost basis is cost basis / balance, and that the wallets add up to the holder's row. The report shows
    # the holdings at the end of the report's to date (not the final ones), whatever its from date. If the to date is before 2025, the report
    # shows them like universal application always did (each wallet gets the average cost), and so do assets in universal application.

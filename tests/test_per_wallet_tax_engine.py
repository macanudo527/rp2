#   "in order of time from the earliest date on which units ... were acquired by the taxpayer" (FIFO by original acquisition date);
# - Rev. Proc. 2024-28: unused basis at 2025-01-01 is allocated to wallets (global allocation or specific unit allocation);
# - IRC §1223: the holding period of transferred units includes the period they were held in the source wallet;

    # The rule in plain English: moving coins between your own wallets changes nothing for tax purposes (IRS FAQ A81), except that the
    # coins paid as a fee are sold (A97). The coins keep their cost and purchase date wherever they go (Treas. Reg. §1.1012-1(j)(1): the
    # date units were transferred into a wallet is disregarded), and at the switch each wallet is given lots that keep the original cost and
    # purchase date of the unused basis (Rev. Proc. 2024-28 §3.04). So when coins come back to a wallet, the wallet must end up with exactly
    # the coins, cost and dates it had before, minus whatever was sold or paid as fees on the way.
    #
    # Example (from the review): buy 10 coins in Coinbase in 2024. At the switch they are allocated to Coinbase. In 2025 move 4 coins to
    # Kraken and then back. Coinbase must hold 10 coins with their $1,000 cost and 2024 purchase date, and Kraken none. Before the fix the
    # returning coins were added to the 2024 purchase (which no wallet holds after the switch) instead of the allocated lot, and the
    # calculation stopped with "returned amount exceeds its crypto_in: 14 > 10".
    #
    # Every case runs with each accounting method: the expected results are the same for all of them.

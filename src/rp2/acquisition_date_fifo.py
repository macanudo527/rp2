# FIFO variant used only in per-wallet application. The chronological FIFO plugin orders lots by their position in the lot list,
# which in a wallet is the order of arrival: a lot transferred into a wallet would then be treated as newer than the lots already
# there, even when it was acquired earlier. Treas. Reg. §1.1012-1(j) orders units "from the earliest date on which units ... were
# acquired by the taxpayer" and adds that "the date any units were transferred into the taxpayer's wallet is disregarded" ((j)(1) and
# (j)(3)(i)), so this variant orders lots by cost_basis_timestamp (the original acquisition date, preserved across transfers). Ties are broken by arrival timestamp in the wallet,
# then by row, so that the order is deterministic.

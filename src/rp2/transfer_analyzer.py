# - InTransactions add a lot to their wallet;
# - OutTransactions dispose of lots in their wallet;
# - IntraTransactions move lots (or parts of lots) from one wallet to another: the "to" side is modeled with artificial InTransactions
#   that point back to the original lot (from_lot) and preserve its cost basis and acquisition date. The crypto fee (sent - received) is
#   paid with the first units selected and is disposed of: IRS FAQ A81 and A97 (digital-asset FAQs) state that the crypto used to pay for a
#   transfer between the taxpayer's own wallets is disposed of, with gain or loss, and A53 that it is not a transaction cost that could be
#   added to the basis of the received units.
# Lots are selected with the accounting method of the year in which the transaction occurs (the same method is used for transfers and
# disposals, so transfer semantics and accounting method are always consistent within a year). While doing so, the analyzer pairs every
# taxable event with the lots it consumed and produces the resulting GainLoss objects.

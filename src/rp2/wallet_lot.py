# In per-wallet application, the units of one lot that one wallet holds at a given moment (e.g. the date of a report). This is the wallet's
# own inventory: each wallet has its own lots, with their own cost basis and acquisition dates (Treas. Reg. §1.1012-1(j)).
# - lot is the lot as the wallet holds it: an input lot, a lot allocated to the wallet at the switch to per-wallet application, or a lot
#   created by a transfer into the wallet. Its original_lot is the input lot it comes from (the source reference shown in reports).
# - amount is how many units of the lot the wallet holds: a lot can be partly sold or partly moved to other wallets.
# Example: buy 2 units for $200 in wallet A, then move 1 unit to wallet B. A holds 1 unit of the purchase (cost basis $100) and B holds 1
# unit of the lot created by the transfer (cost basis $100, same acquisition date, original_lot = the purchase).
